# Drum Kit Game

- Drum kit site: JS animation and sound on click and key commands

**What I enjoyed while building this site:** Adding the sound elements and the two different kinds of commands -- onClick and keyDown. The fact that you can "play the drums" with a keyboard is actually really cool. 

**What I struggled with while building this app:** Connecting the correct sound with the image...I know very little about percussion instruments so I had to look up the differences to make sure that I correctly connecting pictures to sounds!

**Things I learned through building this app:** For being an older language, JavaScript is really flexible and multifaceted.
